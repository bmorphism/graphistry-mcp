# Graphistry FastMCP Server

A [Model-Control-Program (MCP)](https://github.com/llmOS/mcp) server for integrating Graphistry's graph visualization capabilities with LLM workflows, focusing on advanced graph insights and investigations for network analysis, threat detection, and pattern discovery.

Built using [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp), this implementation provides a streamlined API with robust HTTP streaming support.

Developed by the Graphistry Community.

## ðŸš¨ Important: Graphistry Registration Required

**This MCP server requires a free Graphistry account to use visualization features.**

1. Sign up for a free account at [hub.graphistry.com](https://hub.graphistry.com)
2. Set your credentials as environment variables before starting the server:
   ```bash
   export GRAPHISTRY_USERNAME=your_username
   export GRAPHISTRY_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

Without these credentials, certain visualization features will be limited.

## Features

- GPU-accelerated graph visualization via Graphistry
- Advanced pattern discovery and relationship analysis
- Streamable HTTP interface for resumable connections
- Support for various graph data formats (Pandas, NetworkX, edge lists)
- Interactive graph visualization and exploration
- Layout control for different visualization types
- Network investigation and anomaly detection capabilities

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bmorphism/graphistry-mcp.git
cd graphistry-mcp

# Run the setup script which uses uv for dependency management
./setup-graphistry-mcp.sh

# Set up your Graphistry credentials (obtained from hub.graphistry.com)
export GRAPHISTRY_USERNAME=your_username
export GRAPHISTRY_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Usage

### Graphistry Account Setup

Before using this server, you must:

1. Register for a free account at [hub.graphistry.com](https://hub.graphistry.com)
2. Set your credentials as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export GRAPHISTRY_USERNAME=your_username
   export GRAPHISTRY_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

These credentials enable the server to create and access GPU-accelerated visualizations.

### Starting the server

The server can be run in two modes:

1. Standard stdio mode (for typical MCP clients):
```bash
# Make sure your Graphistry credentials are set before running
./start-graphistry-mcp.sh
```

2. HTTP mode (for web-based clients or testing):
```bash
# Make sure your Graphistry credentials are set before running
./start-graphistry-mcp.sh --http 8080
```

### Available Tools

The Graphistry MCP server provides the following tools for graph insights and investigations:

1. **visualize_graph** - Create a graph visualization from different data formats:
   - Supports pandas, networkx, and edge_list formats
   - Customizable node and edge attributes
   - Returns a unique graph ID and visualization URL
   - Reveals patterns and connections in complex data

2. **get_graph_info** - Retrieve information about a stored graph:
   - Access metadata for previously created visualizations
   - Get the visualization URL for sharing
   - Analyze graph metrics and statistics

3. **apply_layout** - Change the layout algorithm for a graph:
   - Force directed layout for natural clustering
   - Radial layout for hierarchical relationship investigation
   - Circle layout for symmetry analysis
   - Grid layout for structural comparisons

4. **detect_patterns** - Identify interesting patterns within graphs:
   - Community detection for network segmentation
   - Path finding between key entities
   - Centrality metrics for key node identification
   - Anomaly detection for outlier identification

### Advanced Visualization Features

The following additional visualization capabilities are available when properly authenticated with Graphistry:

1. **interactive_exploration** - Interact with live visualizations:
   - Pan, zoom, and explore complex graph structures
   - Click nodes and edges to reveal detailed information
   - Filter and highlight specific patterns within the visualization

2. **graph_embedding** - Generate embeddings for graph analysis:
   - Visualize graph embeddings in 2D or 3D space
   - Identify clusters and patterns through dimensional reduction
   - Compare similarity between different graph structures

3. **time_series_analysis** - Visualize how graphs evolve over time:
   - Play back temporal graph changes as animations
   - Track entity relationships as they form and dissolve
   - Identify patterns in temporal network dynamics

4. **annotation_tools** - Add context to your visualizations:
   - Highlight important nodes or relationships
   - Add explanatory text to visualizations
   - Create shareable, annotated graph stories

### Example Client Usage

```python
import asyncio
import os
from mcp.client import Client
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

# Set up Graphistry credentials before starting client
# These should match the credentials used on your Graphistry account
os.environ["GRAPHISTRY_USERNAME"] = "your_graphistry_username"  # Replace with your username
os.environ["GRAPHISTRY_PASSWORD"] = "your_graphistry_password"  # Replace with your password

async def main():
    async with stdio_client() as client:
        # List available tools
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        
        # Create a simple graph
        result = await client.call_tool("visualize_graph", {
            "data_format": "edge_list",
            "edges": [
                {"source": "A", "target": "B"},
                {"source": "B", "target": "C"},
                {"source": "C", "target": "A"}
            ],
            "title": "Triangle Graph"
        })
        
        print(f"Graph created: {result['url']}")
        print("Open this URL in your browser to view your visualization")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

> **Note**: The visualization URL will only work if you have properly set up your Graphistry credentials and have an active account at [hub.graphistry.com](https://hub.graphistry.com).

## Docker Usage

You can also run the server in a Docker container with your Graphistry credentials:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t graphistry-mcp .

# Run the container with environment variables
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GRAPHISTRY_USERNAME=your_username \
  -e GRAPHISTRY_PASSWORD=your_password \
  graphistry-mcp
```

These environment variables will be passed to the container, allowing it to authenticate with Graphistry's services.

# Install development dependencies
uvx pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Format code
